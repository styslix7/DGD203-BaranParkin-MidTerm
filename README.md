# DGD203-BaranParkin-MidTerm

Repo created by Baran ParkÄ±n 2305041025 for mid-terms for lecture of DGD203 - Game Programming 1.

**Description**: This project features a short interaction based game where you give answers to questions and get a unique ending according to that. There are characters and variables like "fuel" to make it more interesting and challenging. There are total 3 endings with one of them being bad and other 2 are good endings. I got inspirted from the project I did for "Writing and Storytelling in Games" lecture in 1st semester, if you remember I created a sci-fi story named "Stellar Deception" with characters like Sylas Vortex and Aria Nova -- they are in this project too!
